# Blockchain

In this repo, I'll be placing all the files generated through my blockchain learning path.

On some part of the learning path, I started using an Ethereum wallet that I downloaded from [here](https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/etherwallet/releases/download/v3.40.0/etherwallet-v3.40.0.zip).
